## Git
**Git** is a distributed version control system used to track changes in source code during software development. It allows multiple developers to work on a project simultaneously without interfering with each other's changes. Here are some key concepts and commands:

1. **Repository**: A storage location for the code and its version history.
2. **Branch**: A parallel version of the repository that diverges from the main working project.
3. **Commit**: A record of changes made to the repository.
4. **Merge**: Combining changes from different branches.
5. **Clone**: Creating a copy of a repository.
6. **Pull**: Fetching and merging changes from a remote repository.
7. **Push**: Sending local changes to a remote repository.
8. **Fetch**: Downloading changes from a remote repository without merging.
9. **Rebase**: Reapplying commits on top of another base tip.
10. **Stash**: Temporarily saving changes that are not ready to be committed.

### Common Git Commands
- `git init`: Initialize a new Git repository.
- `git clone <url>`: Clone a repository from a remote server.
- `git add <file>`: Stage changes for the next commit.

   A Git repository is a storage location where all the files and their revision history are stored. It can be local to a developer's machine or hosted on a remote server.

3. **How do you create a new Git repository?**
   To create a new Git repository, you can use the command `git init` in the desired directory. This initializes an empty repository.

4. **How do you clone a repository?**
   You can clone a repository using `git clone <repository-url>`. This creates a local copy of the repository from the remote server.

5. **What is a commit in Git?**
   A commit is a snapshot of changes made to the repository. It records the state of the project at a specific point in time.

6. **How do you make a commit?**
   To make a commit, you first stage the changes using `git add <file>` and then commit them using `git commit -m "commit message"`.

7. **What is branching in Git?**
   Branching allows you to create a parallel version of the repository to work on new features or changes without affecting the main project. You can later merge the branch back into the main branch.

8. **How do you create a new branch?**
   You can create a new branch using `git branch <branch-name>`. To switch to the new branch, use `git checkout <branch-name>`.

9. **What is merging in Git?**
   Merging is the process of combining changes from one branch into another. This is often done to integrate feature branches into the main branch.

10. **How do you merge branches?**
    To merge branches, first switch to the branch you want to merge into (e.g., `git checkout main`) and then use `git merge <branch-name>`.

11. **What is a pull request?**
    A pull request is a way to propose changes to a repository. It allows other developers to review and discuss the changes before merging them.

12. **What is a conflict in Git?**
    A conflict occurs when changes from different branches cannot be automatically merged. This usually happens when the same lines of code are modified in both branches.

13. **How do you resolve conflicts in Git?**
    To resolve conflicts, you need to manually edit the conflicting files to resolve the differences and then commit the changes.

14. **What is `git stash`?**
    `git stash` temporarily saves changes that are not ready to be committed. This allows you to switch branches or pull updates without losing your changes.

15. **How do you apply stashed changes?**
    To apply stashed changes, use `git stash apply`. If you want to remove the stash after applying it, use `git stash pop`.

16. **What is `git pull`?**
