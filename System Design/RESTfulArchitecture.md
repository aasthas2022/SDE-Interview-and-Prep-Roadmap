# REST API/Architecture

**REST (Representational State Transfer)** is an architectural style for designing networked applications. It relies on a stateless, client-server, cacheable communication protocol -- the HTTP. REST is an architectural style, not a standard, and it defines a set of constraints and properties based on how components of a networked system should communicate.

## Key Principles of REST Architecture

1. **Statelessness**: Each request from a client to a server must contain all the information needed to understand and process the request. The server should not store any context between requests. This simplifies the server design and increases the reliability and scalability of the application.

2. **Client-Server Architecture**: This separates the concerns between client and server. Clients handle the user interface and user experience, while servers manage data storage and business logic. This separation allows for more flexibility and scalability.

3. **Uniform Interface**: This is a key principle that simplifies and decouples the architecture, allowing each part to evolve independently. The uniform interface includes:
   - **Resource Identification**: Resources are identified in requests using URIs (Uniform Resource Identifiers).
   - **Manipulation of Resources through Representations**: When a client holds a representation of a resource, including any metadata attached, it has enough information to modify or delete the resource on the server, provided it has permission.
   - **Self-descriptive Messages**: Each message includes enough information to describe how to process the message. This includes information on how to parse the message payload, its format (e.g., JSON, XML), and the action to perform.
   - **Hypermedia as the Engine of Application State (HATEOAS)**: Clients interact with resources through hypermedia provided dynamically by applications. Hypermedia links allow clients to discover actions they can perform dynamically.

4. **Cacheability**: Responses must define themselves as cacheable or not. If responses are cacheable, clients can reuse them for subsequent requests, improving performance and scalability.

5. **Layered System**: A client cannot ordinarily tell whether it is connected directly to the end server or an intermediary along the way. Intermediary servers can improve system scalability by enabling load balancing and shared caches.

6. **Code on Demand (optional)**: Servers can temporarily extend or customize client functionality by transferring executable code. Examples include JavaScript and applets.

## RESTful Web Services

A web service that adheres to the principles of REST can be referred to as a RESTful web service. RESTful web services typically use HTTP methods explicitly:

- **GET**: Retrieve information from the server (read operations).
- **POST**: Send data to the server (create operations).
- **PUT**: Update existing resources on the server.
- **DELETE**: Remove resources from the server.

## Components of REST Architecture

1. **Resources**: The key abstraction in REST is a resource, which can be any kind of object, data, or service accessible on the server. Each resource is identified by a unique URI.

2. **Representations**: Resources are represented by some data (often JSON or XML). This representation is what is exchanged between the client and server.

3. **State Transitions**: The client progresses through an application by selecting links (hypermedia) and following them. These transitions are driven by the server's responses.

## REST API Design Best Practices

1. **Use Nouns for URIs**: URIs should be based on nouns (resources) rather than verbs (actions). For example, use `/users` rather than `/getUsers`.

2. **Logical Resource Hierarchy**: Arrange URIs hierarchically to represent relationships. For example, `/users/{userId}/orders` for orders belonging to a specific user.

3. **Use HTTP Methods Correctly**:
   - GET for retrieval
   - POST for creation
   - PUT for updating
   - DELETE for deletion

4. **Stateless Operations**: Ensure that each request from the client to the server must contain all the information needed to understand and process the request.

5. **Error Handling**: Use standard HTTP status codes to represent the outcome of operations. For example:
   - `200 OK` for successful requests
   - `201 Created` for successful resource creation
   - `400 Bad Request` for client-side errors
   - `401 Unauthorized` for authentication errors
   - `404 Not Found` for nonexistent resources
   - `500 Internal Server Error` for server-side errors

6. **Versioning**: Include versioning in the URI to handle changes over time, for example, `/api/v1/users`.

7. **Hypermedia**: Utilize HATEOAS to guide clients through the application by providing relevant links in the responses.

## Example REST API Workflow

1. **Resource Identification**:
   - URI: `https://api.example.com/users/{userId}`
   - This URI uniquely identifies a user resource.

2. **GET Request**:
   - Request: `GET https://api.example.com/users/123`
   - Response: `{ "id": 123, "name": "Aastha Shukla", "email": "aastha@example.com" }`
   - The server returns a representation of the user resource.

3. **POST Request**:
   - Request: `POST https://api.example.com/users`
   - Payload: `{ "name": "Aastha Shukla", "email": "aastha@example.com" }`
   - Response: `201 Created`, Location header: `https://api.example.com/users/123`
   - The server creates a new user resource and returns the location of the new resource.

4. **PUT Request**:
   - Request: `PUT https://api.example.com/users/123`
   - Payload: `{ "name": "Aastha S.", "email": "aastha@example.com" }`
   - Response: `200 OK`
   - The server updates the existing user resource.

5. **DELETE Request**:
   - Request: `DELETE https://api.example.com/users/123`
   - Response: `204 No Content`
   - The server deletes the user resource.


## Top 75 RESTful architecture questions

### Basic Concepts

1. **What is a REST API?**
   - **Answer:** REST (Representational State Transfer) API is an architectural style that uses HTTP requests to access and manipulate resources. It uses standard HTTP methods such as GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, and PATCH. REST APIs are stateless and cacheable, allowing interactions with resources identified by URLs.

2. **What are the principles of REST?**
   - **Answer:** The principles of REST are:
     - **Statelessness:** Each request from client to server must contain all the information needed to understand and process the request.
     - **Client-Server Architecture:** The client and server are separate and can evolve independently.
     - **Cacheability:** Responses must define themselves as cacheable or not to prevent clients from reusing stale or inappropriate data.
     - **Layered System:** The architecture can be composed of multiple layers, each with its responsibilities.
     - **Uniform Interface:** A standard way to interact with resources using HTTP methods and conventions.
     - **Code on Demand (optional):** Servers can extend client functionality by transferring executable code.

3. **What are HTTP methods and their purposes?**
   - **Answer:**
     - **GET:** Retrieve data from the server.
     - **POST:** Send data to the server to create a new resource.
     - **PUT:** Update an existing resource or create if it does not exist.
     - **DELETE:** Remove a resource.
     - **PATCH:** Apply partial modifications to a resource.

4. **What are the status codes associated with REST APIs?**
   - **Answer:**
     - **1xx Informational:** Request received, continuing process.
     - **2xx Success:** The action was successfully received, understood, and accepted.
       - 200 OK
       - 201 Created
       - 204 No Content
     - **3xx Redirection:** Further action needs to be taken to complete the request.
       - 301 Moved Permanently
       - 302 Found
       - 304 Not Modified
     - **4xx Client Error:** The request contains bad syntax or cannot be fulfilled.
       - 400 Bad Request
       - 401 Unauthorized
       - 403 Forbidden
       - 404 Not Found
     - **5xx Server Error:** The server failed to fulfill an apparently valid request.
       - 500 Internal Server Error
       - 502 Bad Gateway
       - 503 Service Unavailable

### Advanced Concepts

5. **Explain idempotency and its importance in REST APIs.**
   - **Answer:** Idempotency means that multiple identical requests have the same effect as a single request. This is crucial for ensuring reliability, especially in the event of network issues where requests might be repeated. Methods like GET, PUT, and DELETE are idempotent, while POST is not.

6. **What is HATEOAS?**
   - **Answer:** Hypermedia as the Engine of Application State (HATEOAS) is a constraint of REST, providing clients with information on what they can do next. Resources return links to related resources, helping clients navigate the API dynamically.

7. **What is the difference between PUT and PATCH?**
   - **Answer:** PUT updates a resource entirely, requiring the client to send a complete representation of the resource. PATCH, on the other hand, applies partial updates, allowing the client to send only the changes.

8. **How do you handle versioning in REST APIs?**
   - **Answer:** Versioning can be managed in several ways:
     - **URL Versioning:** Including the version in the URL path (e.g., `/v1/resource`).
     - **Query Parameters:** Using query parameters to specify the version (e.g., `/resource?version=1`).
     - **Headers:** Including the version in HTTP headers (e.g., `Accept: application/vnd.example.v1+json`).

9. **What is the purpose of rate limiting and how can it be implemented?**
   - **Answer:** Rate limiting controls the number of requests a client can make to an API within a given timeframe, preventing abuse and ensuring fair use. It can be implemented using techniques like:
     - **Fixed Window:** Limits requests based on fixed time intervals.
     - **Sliding Window:** Limits requests based on a rolling time period.
     - **Token Bucket:** Uses tokens to allow a certain number of requests.

### Security
